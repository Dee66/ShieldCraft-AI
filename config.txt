Expand the Pydantic schema to cover all config sections and nested fields.
Enforce strict schema validation on every config load and reload; fail fast on invalid configs.
Extend the referential integrity script to check uniqueness, cross-resource references, and value constraints.
Add semantic validation, such as enforcing S3 removal policies and cost controls for production.
Store all configs in Git; require pull requests and code reviews for every change.
Log and audit all config changes, and enable easy rollback to previous versions.
Automate promotion of configs from dev to staging to prod, with validation gates at each step.
Ensure strict isolation of environment-specific configs and secrets.
Refactor the config loader to support additional backends, such as AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store.
Allow runtime overrides, but always validate them against the schema.
Assign an AI agent to monitor config health and run integrity checks continuously.
Implement anomaly detection for config drift or suspicious changes.
Enable automated remediation of config issues, with human-in-the-loop approval for production.
Auto-generate config documentation from the schema.
Build a CLI or web UI for browsing, diffing, and validating configs.
Implement config fuzzing to test edge cases and adversarial scenarios.
Add a simulation mode for safe, sandboxed config changes.
Move all secrets to AWS Secrets Manager and reference ARNs in the config files.
Restrict and audit access to config changes, especially in production.
Run validation and integrity checks in parallel across environments.
Shard large configs by service or resource type for independent validation.
