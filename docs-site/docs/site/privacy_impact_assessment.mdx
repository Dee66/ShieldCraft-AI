# Privacy Impact Assessment & Compliance Review

This document details the privacy impact assessment (PIA) process and outlines the regular compliance review schedule for ShieldCraft AI, ensuring alignment with [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [SOC2](https://www.aicpa.org/resources/soc-2), [POPIA](https://www.justice.gov.za/inforeg/docs/InfoRegSA-POPIA-act2021.pdf), and other relevant frameworks.

## 1. Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

**Purpose:**
- Identify and mitigate privacy risks related to personal and sensitive data processing.
- Ensure compliance with data protection laws ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [POPIA](https://www.justice.gov.za/inforeg/docs/InfoRegSA-POPIA-act2021.pdf), etc.).

**Scope:**
- All data flows, storage, and processing activities within ShieldCraft AI.

**Key Steps:**
1. Data Mapping: Document all personal data collected, processed, and stored.
2. Risk Identification: Assess risks to data subjects (e.g., unauthorized access, data leakage).
3. Mitigation Measures: Define and implement controls (encryption, access controls, minimization).
4. Stakeholder Review: Involve DPO, legal, and technical leads in assessment.
5. Documentation: Maintain records of processing activities and risk mitigations.

**Status:**
- Initial PIA completed (see [Risk Log](./risk_log)).
- Ongoing reviews scheduled (see below).

## 3. Data Subject Rights & Requests

ShieldCraft AI supports all major data subject rights under GDPR, POPIA, and similar frameworks:
- Right of access: Data subjects can request details of their personal data held and processed.
- Right to rectification: Data subjects can request corrections to inaccurate data.
- Right to erasure: Data subjects can request deletion of their personal data (subject to legal/regulatory constraints).
- Right to restrict processing: Data subjects can request limited processing of their data.
- Right to data portability: Data subjects can request export of their data in a machine-readable format.
- Right to object: Data subjects can object to certain types of processing.

**Process:**
- Requests are submitted via designated channels (e.g., support portal, DPO email).
- All requests are logged, tracked, and responded to within regulatory timeframes.
- Responses and actions are documented for audit purposes.

## Next Steps
- Schedule next quarterly and annual compliance reviews.
- Review and update PIA documentation as new data flows or services are added.
- Ensure all data subject request channels are operational and documented.
