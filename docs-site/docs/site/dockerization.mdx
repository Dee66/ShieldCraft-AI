# Docker & Chainguard

A comprehensive guide to containerization and secure image practices for ShieldCraft AI. This document is standardized for Docusaurus display and clarity, and aligns with MLOps and cloud-native best practices.

---

## Overview
ShieldCraft AI uses a modern, multi-stage [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) build process for all core services (**main**, **api**, **ingestion**), leveraging [Chainguard Python](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/python) images for minimal attack surface and zero-known CVEs. This ensures secure, reproducible, and environment-specific containers for development, staging, and production. All images are built and published using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI/CD pipelines, with automated vulnerability scanning via [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) and [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

---

## Build Stages & Process
- **Base Image:** Start from [Chainguard Python](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/python) for security and compliance.
- **Dependency Install:** Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python dependency management, ensuring reproducible builds.
- **Source Copy:** Copy only required source files and assets to minimize image size and attack surface.
- **Build/Compile:** Compile assets, run tests ([pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)), and validate environment.
- **Final Image:** Use multi-stage builds to produce a minimal, production-ready image.
- **Tagging & Publishing:** Tag images by environment (dev, staging, prod) and publish to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

---

## Orchestration & CI
- **Local Development:** Use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for multi-service orchestration and local testing.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy containers to [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) or [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) for scalable, managed orchestration.
- **CI/CD:** Automate builds, tests, and deployments with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Integrate security scans and image signing for supply chain integrity.

---

## Security & Best Practices
- Use minimal base images ([Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/)) to reduce vulnerabilities.
- Scan images for CVEs with [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) and [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).
- Store secrets securely using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and avoid hardcoding credentials.
- Enable image signing and provenance tracking for compliance.
- Regularly update dependencies and base images to patch vulnerabilities.
- Use [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) roles for least-privilege access in cloud deployments.
