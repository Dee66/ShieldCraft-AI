# Dockerfiles & Compose: Security, Reproducibility, Best Practices
This document details the hardening and best practices applied to all Dockerfiles, Compose files, and related automation for ShieldCraft AI.

## 1. Hardened Dockerfiles
- **Multiple Dockerfiles:**
  - [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) (base), [`Dockerfile.api`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), [`Dockerfile.ingestion`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for separation of concerns
  - Each service has a minimal, purpose-built image for its function (API, ingestion, etc.)
- **Distroless & Minimal Images:**
  - All production images use [Google Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) or [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)/slim variants for minimal attack surface
  - No shell or package manager in final images
- **Multi-Stage Builds:**
  - Build dependencies and tools are only present in intermediate stages ([Multi-stage Docker Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/))
  - Final images contain only runtime and app code
- **Security:**
  - Non-root users enforced in all images ([Docker Security Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/))
  - Drop all Linux capabilities except those required ([Linux Capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities))
  - Regular vulnerability scanning ([Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)) in CI/CD
  - No secrets or credentials in images; use environment variables and [secrets management](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
- **Reproducibility:**
  - All base images and dependencies are pinned to specific versions
  - [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) excludes unnecessary files (tests, docs, local configs)
  - Build args and environment variables for dev, staging, and prod
- **Best Practices:**
  - [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) defined for all services (API, ingestion, etc.)
  - Layer caching optimized for fast builds and CI/CD
  - Image size minimized for fast deploys and reduced attack surface
  - [Labels and metadata](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label) for traceability

## 2. Docker Compose & Environments
- **Three Environments:**
  - `dev`: Local development with hot-reload, debug tools, and test data
  - `staging`: Mirrors production, used for integration and pre-release testing
  - `prod`: Hardened, minimal, and monitored for production workloads
- **Service Isolation:**
  - Separate services for API, ingestion, vector DB, etc.
  - Network segmentation, explicit port mappings, and no unnecessary inter-service communication ([Docker Compose Networking](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/))
- **Security:**
  - No privileged containers; drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities
  - Environment variables and secrets managed via [.env](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) and external secrets store
  - Volumes and mounts restricted to only what is needed ([Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/))
  - Read-only root filesystem where possible ([Read-only Filesystem](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#read-only-filesystem))
- **Reproducibility:**
  - Compose files versioned, peer-reviewed, and environment-specific overrides
  - Consistent local and CI/CD builds
  - Automated smoke tests after build/deploy ([Smoke Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software))

## 3. Nox & Automation
- **Noxfile orchestrates:**
  - [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) for linting, testing, building, and running containers for all environments
  - Automated checks for Dockerfile and Compose best practices
  - Integration with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks and CI/CD pipelines
  - Automated vulnerability scans and dependency updates

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement
- **Regular reviews** of Dockerfiles and Compose for new vulnerabilities and optimizations
- **Automated dependency updates** and security patching
- **Documentation** for onboarding, troubleshooting, and environment setup
- **Incident response:** Documented process for patching and rolling out new images in case of CVEs ([CVE Details](https://cve.mitre.org/))

---

## Next Steps
- Review and update Dockerfiles and Compose files for new vulnerabilities and optimizations
- Automate dependency updates and security patching in CI/CD
- Document onboarding, troubleshooting, and environment setup
- Maintain incident response process for CVEs and image patching
