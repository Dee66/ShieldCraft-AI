# Automated Alert Triage, Investigation, and Remediation

ShieldCraft AI transforms security operations by automating the entire alert lifecycle from triage and investigation to remediation using advanced GenAI and AWS-native integrations. This approach accelerates incident response, reduces false positives, and minimizes business disruption, empowering SOC teams to focus on strategic priorities.

## Key Features
- **Rapid Incident Triage:** Alerts are automatically ingested, classified, and prioritized based on risk, context, and business impact.
- **Automated Investigation:** GenAI models analyze alert data, correlate with threat intelligence, and surface actionable insights for SOC analysts.
- **False Positive Reduction:** Intelligent filtering and enrichment minimize noise, ensuring teams focus on genuine threats.
- **Business Disruption Minimization:** Automated playbooks trigger remediation steps, containing threats before they escalate.

## How It Works
1. **Alert Ingestion:** ShieldCraft AI integrates with AWS security services (e.g., GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudWatch) to collect and normalize alerts.
2. **GenAI Analysis:** Alerts are analyzed using GenAI models, which assess severity, context, and potential impact.
3. **Automated Playbooks:** Predefined and adaptive playbooks execute remediation actions (e.g., isolating resources, updating IAM policies) within secure guardrails.
4. **SOC Review & Override:** Analysts can review, approve, or override automated actions, maintaining human-in-the-loop assurance.
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Real-time feedback loops refine detection, response, and playbook logic for ongoing optimization.

## Architectural Insights
- **Modular, Cloud-Native Design:** Built on AWS CDK, Lambda, and Step Functions for scalable, maintainable automation.
**Deep AWS Integration:** Harnesses a multi-stack AWS architecture spanning VPC, IAM, S3, Lake Formation, Glue, Lambda, MSK, Airbyte, OpenSearch, SageMaker, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, Config, Budgets, and more for comprehensive coverage, rapid response, and enterprise-grade automation. This enables secure data flows, fine-grained governance, scalable analytics, and resilient operations across the entire security lifecycle.
- **GenAI-Powered Automation:** Uses LLMs and custom models to drive intelligent triage, investigation, and remediation.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Simulation and real-world outcomes feed into ShieldCraft AI’s risk engine, improving future responses.
