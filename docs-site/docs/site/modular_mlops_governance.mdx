## Benefits

---

## 2. MLOps Flow
- **Automated Pipelines:**
  - Data ingestion, validation, and versioning
  - Model training, evaluation, and registry (SageMaker/MLflow)
  - Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for models and code
  - Canary and shadow deployments for safe model updates
- **Experiment Tracking:**
  - All experiments logged with parameters, metrics, and artifacts
  - Rollback and audit trails for all model changes
- **Monitoring & Feedback:**
  - Automated monitoring for drift, performance, and cost
  - Human-in-the-loop feedback for prompt/model improvement

---

## 3. Security & Data Governance
- **Data Privacy:**
  - Masking, anonymization, and minimization at ingestion and processing
  - Data retention and deletion policies
  - Regular privacy impact assessments ([see doc](/privacy_impact_assessment))
- **Access Control:**
  - IAM roles and least-privilege access
  - Centralized secrets management ([see doc](/security/aws-secrets-management))
  - Audit logging for all access and changes
- **Compliance:**
  - Automated checks for GDPR, SOC2, POPIA, etc.
  - Documentation and evidence collection for audits
  - Regular reviews and updates ([see doc](/ethics_compliance))
- **Security Posture:**
  - Threat modeling and adversarial testing ([see doc](/threat_modeling))
  - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
  - Incident response plan and runbooks
