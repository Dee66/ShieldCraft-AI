## Lifecycle Stages

1. **Use Case Discovery & Success Criteria**
   - Identify where GenAI delivers the most value for ShieldCraft AI.
   - Define clear, measurable outcomes and ensure all use cases are security-relevant and high-impact.
2. **Data Preparation & Retrieval**
   - Ground GenAI in high-quality, relevant security data.
   - Build robust pipelines for ingest, clean, and structure data for RAG and LLMs.
3. **Model Selection & Prototyping**
   - Select, integrate, and rapidly prototype with LLMs and RAG pipelines.
   - Focus on measurable, iterative improvement.
4. **Application Integration & Orchestration**
   - Build robust, production-ready application logic that leverages GenAI.
   - Integrate with APIs, dashboards, and ensure reliability.
5. **Evaluation, Testing & Continuous Improvement**
   - Continuously evaluate and refine GenAI performance using both automated and human-in-the-loop feedback.
6. **Deployment, MLOps & Monitoring**
   - Operationalize GenAI for reliability, scalability, and security in production.
