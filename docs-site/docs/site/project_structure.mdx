# Project Structure, Version Control & Docusaurus Docs
This document describes the initial setup of the ShieldCraft AI project structure, version control strategy, and documentation system using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## 1. Project Structure
The repository uses a monorepo layout, grouping all code, documentation, and infrastructure in a single place for easier management and traceability. Key top-level folders include:
- `src/` – Main application code (API, ingestion, core logic)
- `tests/` – Automated tests
- `docs-site/` – Docusaurus documentation site
- `nox_sessions/` – Automation scripts for CI/CD, linting, and developer workflow
- `notebooks/` – [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks for experiments and analysis
- `infrastructure/` – Infrastructure as code ([IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)) and deployment assets
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts
- `config/`, `data/`, `logs/`, and others for supporting assets
- **Naming conventions:** snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for docs.
- **Security:** Secrets and environment files are excluded via `.gitignore`.

## 2. Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for all code and documentation
- **Branching model:** `main` (production), `dev` (integration), feature branches (`feature/*`)
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Linting, formatting, and security checks automated ([pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/))
- **Commit message style:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Pull request workflow:** All changes reviewed before merge
- **Automated checks:** CI runs tests, lint, and build on PRs

## 3. Docusaurus Documentation
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) powers the `docs-site/` for all project documentation
- **Live preview:** `npm start` in `docs-site/` for local docs
- **Docs structure:** Mirrors repo layout for easy navigation
- **Custom theme:** Dark mode, ShieldCraft branding, and progress bar
- **Checklist integration:** Implementation checklist auto-updates progress
- **Cross-linking:** All docs interlinked for seamless navigation

## Next Steps
- Review and update project structure as new components are added
- Document onboarding and contribution guidelines
- Ensure version control and documentation practices are followed
