# AWS Stack Architecture & Dependency Map

A comprehensive overview of the AWS stack architecture, roles, dependencies, and best practices for ShieldCraft AI. This document is standardized for Docusaurus display and clarity.

---

## Recent Architectural Improvements & Best Practices

- Improved stack isolation and security boundaries
- Enhanced data governance and access controls
- Automated data quality validation
- Centralized secrets management
- Cost guardrails and budget alerts

---

## Stack Roles & Responsibilities

| Stack | Role | Key Resources |
|---|---|---|
| **networking** | Foundational network isolation and security | VPC, subnets, security groups, vault secret (imported) |
| **s3** | Centralized object storage for all data and artifacts | S3 buckets, vault secret (imported) |
| **lakeformation** | Data governance and fine-grained access control | Lake Formation resources, permissions, vault secret (imported) |
| **glue** | ETL, data cataloging, and analytics | Glue jobs, crawlers, catalog, vault secret (imported) |
| **lambda** | Event-driven compute and orchestration | Lambda functions, triggers, vault secret (imported) |
| **dataquality** | Automated data quality checks and validation | Quality rules, validation jobs, vault secret (imported) |
| **airbyte** | Connector-based data ingestion and movement | ECS services, connectors, vault secret (imported) |
| **opensearch** | Search and analytics for logs and data | OpenSearch domains, vault secret (imported) |
| **cloud_native_hardening** | Cross-cutting security, monitoring, compliance | CloudWatch alarms, Config rules, IAM boundaries, vault secret (imported) |
| **attack_simulation** | Automated attack simulation and security validation | Lambda functions, CloudWatch alarms, imported secret ARN, vault secret (imported) |
| **secrets_manager** | Centralized secrets management for all environments | AWS Secrets Manager secrets, resource policies, cross-stack exports |
| **msk** | Managed streaming for Kafka workloads | MSK clusters, vault secret (imported) |
| **sagemaker** | Model training, deployment, and monitoring | SageMaker endpoints, models, monitoring, vault secret (imported) |
| **budget** | Cost guardrails, budget alerts, and multi-channel notifications | AWS Budgets, SNS topics, email alerts, vault secret (imported) |
| **cloudformation** | Orchestration and lifecycle management of all AWS stacks | CloudFormation stacks, stack outputs, cross-stack references |

## Expanded Dependency Matrix (Outputs & Inputs)

| Stack | Exports (CfnOutput) | Consumed By (Fn.import_value) | Notes on Parallelism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AirbyteStack** | Endpoints, role ARN, vault secret ARN | (If needed by other stacks) |  |
| **AttackSimulationStack** | Lambda ARN, alarm ARN, imported secret ARN | Security, audit, downstream consumers | Can run in parallel with other compute stacks |
| **BudgetStack** | Budget ARNs, SNS topic ARN, vault secret ARN | All teams, FinOps, notifications | Deployed last, depends on all infra |
| **CloudFormationStack** | Stack outputs, exported values, orchestration metadata | All stacks (as orchestrator) | Runs before/with all stacks, manages dependencies and lifecycle |
| **CloudNativeHardeningStack** | Security findings, config rules, vault secret ARN | (If needed by other stacks) |  |
| **ComplianceStack** | Compliance reports, Lambda ARNs, vault secret ARN | (If needed by other stacks) |  |
| **DataQualityStack** | Metrics, alerts, vault secret ARN | (If needed by other stacks) |  |
| **GlueStack** | Glue DB/catalog name, vault secret ARN | LakeFormationStack, DataQualityStack | GlueStack must finish before dependents |
| **IamRoleStack** | All required IAM role ARNs | All stacks needing roles | Deploy first or in parallel, outputs must exist before import |
| **LakeFormationStack** | Admin role, permissions, vault secret ARN | (If needed by other stacks) |  |
| **LambdaStack** | Lambda ARNs, vault secret ARN | DataQualityStack, ComplianceStack, AttackSimulationStack |  |
| **MskStack** | Broker info, client/producer/consumer roles, vault secret ARN | LambdaStack, AirbyteStack, etc. |  |
| **NetworkingStack** | VPC ID, SG IDs, Flow Logs ARN, vault secret ARN | All compute/data stacks | Same as above |
| **OpenSearchStack** | Endpoint, role ARN, vault secret ARN | Analytics, LambdaStack |  |
| **S3Stack** | data_bucket name/ARN, vault secret ARN | GlueStack, LakeFormationStack, etc. | S3Stack must finish before dependent stacks |
| **SageMakerStack** | Endpoint, role ARN, vault secret ARN | ML pipeline, LambdaStack |  |
| **SecretsManagerStack** | Secret ARNs, resource policies | All stacks needing secrets | Deploy first for secret availability |
| **StepFunctionsStack** | State machine ARN, workflow outputs | LambdaStack, SageMakerStack, DataQualityStack | Can run in parallel with other workflow stacks |
