## Application to Generative AI Implementation Lifecycle Steps

### 1. Discovery & Use Case Definition
- Use [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) and [Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) to prototype and validate use cases.
- Document requirements and success criteria.

### 2. Data Preparation & Retrieval Strategy
- Use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for data cleaning and transformation.
- Integrate with cloud storage and data lakes.

### 3. Model Selection, Prompt Engineering & Initial Prototyping
- Rapid prototyping with [Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html), [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), and [LangChain](https://langchain.com/).
- Experiment with prompt engineering and model selection.

### 4. Application Integration & Orchestration
- Build APIs with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
- Orchestrate workflows with [LangChain](https://langchain.com/).

### 5. Evaluation, Testing & Refinement
- Use [nbval](https://nbval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing notebooks and code.
- Track experiments and results with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

### 6. Deployment, MLOps & Monitoring
- Deploy models with [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).
- Monitor performance and drift.
- Manage dependencies and packaging with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
