# üß™ Automated Attack Simulation

ShieldCraft AI leverages AWS-native and GenAI-powered attack simulation to proactively validate your cloud security posture. By emulating real-world adversarial techniques including ransomware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration ShieldCraft AI enables continuous control validation and rapid identification of gaps before they can be exploited.

## Key Features
- Continuous, scheduled, and on-demand simulations using AWS services and custom playbooks
- GenAI-driven scenario generation for novel, polymorphic attack chains
- Integration with AWS Lambda, Step Functions, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudWatch
- Automated remediation for detected gaps
- Reporting and audit trails for compliance

## How It Works
1. Scenario selection from a library of AWS-specific attacks or custom GenAI-generated scenarios
2. Simulation execution in isolated environments using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and custom scripts
3. Detection and response validation via GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudWatch
4. Automated remediation and detailed reporting

## Architectural Insights
- Modular, cloud-native design built on AWS CDK, Lambda, and Step Functions
- Safe, isolated testing with no impact to production workloads
- Extensible playbook library for evolving threat models
- Continuous feedback loops for ongoing improvement
