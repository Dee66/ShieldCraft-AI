# Build Data Ingestion Pipelines Implementation Plan
## Overview
This document details the strategy, design, and implementation steps for the **Build data ingestion pipelines** section of the ShieldCraft AI checklist. The goal is to create a modular, cloud-native, and reproducible data ingestion architecture using [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) and best-in-class open-source tools.

## Guiding Question
> How do we design ingestion pipelines that are modular, reproducible, secure, and ready for enterprise scale?

## Definition of Done
> All ingestion infrastructure and code is defined as code, parameterized for environments, and supports secure, governed, and observable data flows from source to lake.

## Key Technologies
- [Amazon MSK (Kafka)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/): Streaming backbone
- [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/): Connector-based data integration
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Event-driven processing
- [Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/data-ingestion.html): Log/metric streaming
- [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/): ETL and normalization
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Data lake
- [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/): Governance
- [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/)/[Deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ): Data quality

## Implementation Strategy
### 1. Infrastructure as Code ([AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html))
- All resources (MSK, S3, Glue, Lambda, networking, IAM, etc.) are defined in AWS CDK for full reproducibility and automation.
- Parameterize for dev/staging/prod environments.
### 2. [Amazon MSK (Kafka)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) Cluster
- Use `aws-cdk-lib.aws_msk` to define the cluster (Standard or Serverless).
- Place brokers in private subnets, restrict access via security groups.
- Enable encryption, logging, and IAM authentication.
- Use a Lambda-backed custom resource to automate topic creation.
- Export broker endpoints and topic names for downstream use.
### 3. [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) Integration
- Deploy Airbyte in ECS/EKS (or managed Airbyte Cloud).
- Use exported MSK endpoints and topics for source/target connectors.
- Parameterize connector configs for different data sources.
### 4. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for Event-Driven Processing
- Define Lambda functions (in CDK) to consume from MSK topics.
- Use IAM roles and VPC config for secure access.
- Implement pre-processing, filtering, and routing logic.
### 5. [Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/data-ingestion.html)
- Use Kafka Connect or Lambda to forward data from MSK to OpenSearch.
- Configure index mappings and retention policies.
### 6. [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) for ETL
- Define Glue streaming and batch jobs in CDK.
- Process data from MSK topics and write to S3.
- Use Glue Data Catalog for schema management.
### 7. [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Data Lake
- Store all raw and processed data in S3 buckets.
- Apply Lake Formation governance and access controls.
### 8. Data Quality & Governance
- Integrate [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/)/[Deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ) for automated data quality checks.
- Enforce privacy, retention, and compliance policies via Lake Formation and Glue.

---

## Next Steps
- Scaffold the CDK stack for MSK, S3, networking, and IAM.
- Implement Lambda-backed custom resource for Kafka topic creation.
- Define standard topic names/configs and parameterize for environments.
- Document integration patterns for Airbyte, Lambda, Glue, and OpenSearch.
- Add governance, data quality, and compliance automation.
