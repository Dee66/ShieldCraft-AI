## Cloud Usage Estimate (MVP Phase)
All pricing is estimated in South African Rand (ZAR/R), based on AWS public pricing as of July 2025. Actual costs may vary by region, usage, and discounts. Exchange rate used: 1 USD ≈ R18.50.

| Service/Resource         | Usage/Notes                                 | Unit Price (R)    | Monthly Qty   | Est. Monthly (R) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------:|-------------:|----------------:|
| **Compute**             | 2-3 t3.medium EC2/ECS/EKS nodes (24/7)      |        R1,200/node |          2.5 |         R3,000  |

| **Storage: RDS/Postgres**| 50GB + db.t3.medium (HA)                   |        R1,400/inst |            1 |         R1,400  |
|                         | Storage (50GB)                             |           R0.50/GB |           50 |            R25  |
| **Networking**          | 1TB egress                                 |           R1.80/GB |        1,000 |         R1,800  |
| **Bedrock/LLM**         | 100K tokens (pilot)                        |     R0.15/1K tokens |          100 |            R15  |

**Notes:**
- Compute: t3.medium on-demand, average 2.5 nodes (mix of [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)/[EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)/[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/))
- RDS: Single db.t3.medium instance, 50GB storage, multi-AZ not included
- S3: Standard storage, excludes infrequent access/archive
- Networking: 1TB egress, intra-AWS traffic not included
- Bedrock/LLM: Based on pilot usage, may increase with scale
- Lambda/SQS/SNS: Within free tier for most months, but included for buffer
- Support/Buffer: For minor services, price changes, or overages
