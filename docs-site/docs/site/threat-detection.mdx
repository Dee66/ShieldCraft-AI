# Threat Detection

ShieldCraft AI delivers predictive threat intelligence and prioritization by correlating your AWS cloud posture with global threat data, adversary tactics, and real-time telemetry. This enables security teams to anticipate, prioritize, and neutralize the most relevant risks before they impact the business.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Risk Scoring:** Uses GenAI and advanced analytics to forecast which vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are most likely to be exploited in your environment.
- **Threat Actor Mapping:** Correlates your AWS resources and activity with known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from sources like MITRE ATT&CK and AWS threat intelligence feeds.
- **Automated Prioritization:** Ranks alerts and findings based on business impact, exploitability, and threat likelihood, enabling focused remediation.
- **Continuous Intelligence:** Ingests and analyzes threat feeds, vulnerability databases, and cloud telemetry for up-to-date risk assessment.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides clear, data-driven recommendations for mitigation, response, and ongoing improvement.

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion:** ShieldCraft AI collects cloud telemetry, AWS resource metadata, and external threat intelligence feeds.
2. **GenAI Analysis:** Models analyze the data to identify patterns, emerging threats, and likely attack paths.
3. **Risk Scoring & Prioritization:** Vulnerabilities and alerts are scored and ranked based on context, business impact, and threat likelihood.
4. **Recommendations:** Actionable guidance is provided for remediation, response, and strategic improvement.
5. **Continuous Feedback:** Outcomes and analyst feedback are used to refine models and improve future prioritization.

## Architectural Insights
- **Cloud-Native Integration:** Built on AWS Lambda, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and custom analytics pipelines for scalable, real-time intelligence.
- **GenAI-Driven Analytics:** Uses LLMs and custom models to correlate, score, and prioritize threats with high accuracy.
- **Extensible Data Sources:** Supports integration with MITRE ATT&CK, AWS threat feeds, CVE databases, and more.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates dashboards and reports for SOC teams, compliance, and executive stakeholders.
