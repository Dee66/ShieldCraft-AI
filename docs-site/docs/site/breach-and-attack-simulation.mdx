# Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)

BAS is a cornerstone of modern security, enabling continuous validation and resilience against evolving threats. ShieldCraft AI’s BAS capabilities allow organizations to safely emulate breach scenarios, validate controls, and drive automated remediation for proactive, enterprise-grade defense.

## Key Features
- Continuous BAS for detection, response, and remediation workflow validation
- Customizable attack scenarios tailored to your AWS environment
- Integration with AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and CloudWatch for end-to-end visibility
- Automated evidence collection for SOC2, ISO 27001, and other compliance frameworks

## How It Works
1. Select or generate breach scenarios relevant to your cloud posture
2. Execute simulations using AWS-native services and ShieldCraft AI orchestration
3. Monitor detection and response workflows
4. Collect evidence and generate compliance reports

## Architectural Insights
