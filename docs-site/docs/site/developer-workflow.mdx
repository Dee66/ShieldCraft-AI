# Developer Workflow (Best-in-Class)

A guide to rapid onboarding, cloud-native development, and best practices for ShieldCraft AI engineers. This document is standardized for Docusaurus display and clarity.

## Getting Started

ShieldCraft AI is designed for rapid onboarding and cloud-native development. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dee66/ShieldCraft-AI
   cd shieldcraft-ai
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Configure AWS SSO/Identity Center:**
   - All region/account selection is dynamic and environment-driven.
   - If you encounter authentication issues, ensure your SSO session is active:
     ```bash
     aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
     ```
   - Set your AWS profile and region as needed:
     ```bash
     export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>
     export AWS_REGION=<your-region>
     ```

3. **Run the developer automation scripts:**
   - Use `./scripts/commit-script.sh` for standardized commits and CI/CD integration.
   - For more details, see comments in `scripts/commit-script.sh` and `noxfile.py`.

4. **Follow MLOps best practices:**
   - Use infrastructure-as-code (CDK) for stack deployments.
   - Validate configuration files before pushing changes.
   - Run tests and linting via Nox sessions:
     ```bash
     poetry run nox -s test
     poetry run nox -s lint
     ```

5. **Collaborate and contribute:**
   - All code reviews and merges follow GitHub flow.
   - Document architectural decisions in ADRs.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If you encounter AWS authentication issues, always check your SSO session and environment variables.
- For parallel development, leverage branch-based workflows and CI/CD automation.
- Reference the [Checklist](/checklist) and [Security & Governance](/security_governance) docs for compliance and onboarding guidance.
