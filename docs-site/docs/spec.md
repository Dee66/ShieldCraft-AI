      <li>Firewall and DNS logs.</li>
      <li>Additional critical context: Outputs from vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, Qualys), active network discovery tools (e.g., port scanning results), cloud configuration logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) outputs (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne), and relevant physical access logs will also be integrated to enrich behavioral profiles and identify known attack surfaces and misconfigurations. The correlation of these diverse sources is key to holistic insights.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Data Privacy & Compliance:</b> Continuous review of data handling and privacy impact, aligning with identified privacy and compliance requirements. The platform's granular access controls, encryption, and comprehensive audit trails support adherence to various regulatory compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), with detailed reporting capabilities for audit purposes.</li>
