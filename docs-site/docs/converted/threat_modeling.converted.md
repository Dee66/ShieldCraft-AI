# üõ°Ô∏è ShieldCraft AI: Threat Modeling & Adversarial Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the threat modeling and adversarial testing (including red teaming of GenAI outputs) for ShieldCraft AI. These activities are essential to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security, safety, and ethical risks in GenAI systems.

---

### Threat Modeling Approach

* Methodology:STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) adapted for GenAI and data pipelines.
* Scope:Covers API, data ingestion, model inference, output delivery, and user interaction layers.
* Assets:Sensitive data, model weights, prompts, outputs, user credentials, audit logs.
* Attackers:External threat actors, malicious insiders, supply chain risks, prompt injection adversaries.

---

### Adversarial Testing & Red Teaming

* Red Team Exercises:Simulate real-world attacks on GenAI outputs (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage, bias exploitation).
* Automated Adversarial Testing:Use tools to generate adversarial prompts and test model robustness.
* Manual Review:Security and domain experts review outputs for unsafe, biased, or non-compliant responses.
* Incident Logging:All adversarial findings are logged and tracked to resolution.

### Key Risks & Mitigations

| Threat | Example | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt injection | Adversary manipulates LLM output via crafted input | Input validation, output filtering, prompt hardening, allow-listing |
| Jailbreaks | Bypass model safety guardrails | Regular red teaming, update prompts, monitor for new attack patterns |
| Data leakage | Model reveals sensitive or proprietary info | Prompt engineering, output review, data masking, access controls |
| Bias exploitation | Adversary triggers biased or harmful outputs | Bias audits, adversarial prompt testing, explainability tools |
| Denial of Service | Flooding API/model with requests | Rate limiting, authentication, anomaly detection |

---

## üìã Next Steps

* Schedule regular red team/adversarial testing sessions (at least quarterly).
* Integrate threat modeling into design reviews and architecture updates.
* Log and track all findings in theRisk Log.
