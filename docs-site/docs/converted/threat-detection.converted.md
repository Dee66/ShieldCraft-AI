# üîç Proactive, Predictive Threat Detection (ML, GenAI, UEBA)

ShieldCraft AI leverages advanced machine learning, generative AI (Amazon Bedrock, LangChain), and user/entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to identify and respond to novel threats in real time. This capability is foundational to proactive, adaptive defense against zero-days, insider risks, and AI-driven attacks.

## Key Features

* Real-Time Threat Detection:ML models and GenAI continuously analyze logs, telemetry, and behavioral signals to surface emerging threats as they happen.
* User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):Baselines normal activity and flags anomalies, insider risks, and lateral movement using advanced statistical and deep learning techniques.
* GenAI-Driven Insights:Amazon Bedrock and LangChain orchestrate context-aware threat analysis, summarization, and automated recommendations for SOC teams.
* Zero-Day & Novel Attack Response:Detects unknown threats by correlating behavioral deviations, threat intelligence, and AI-driven pattern recognition.
* Continuous Model Improvement:Automated retraining and feedback loops ensure models adapt to new attack vectors and evolving environments.
* Integration with Automated Attack Simulation & BAS:Threat detection is validated and stress-tested against simulated attacks for ongoing resilience.

## How It Works

* Data is ingested from diverse sources (logs, endpoints, cloud, network flows) and processed in real time.
* ML and GenAI models analyze data for anomalies, suspicious patterns, and known/unknown threat signatures.
* UEBA modules baseline user and entity activity, flagging deviations and potential insider threats.
* Threats are prioritized, summarized, and routed to SOC dashboards for rapid investigation and response.
* Automated feedback and retraining ensure continuous improvement and adaptation.

## Architectural Insights

* Threat detection pipelines are modular, scalable, and cloud-native, leveraging AWS services for compute, storage, and orchestration.
* GenAI components (Bedrock, LangChain) are integrated for advanced reasoning, summarization, and automated triage.
* All detection logic is validated against simulated attacks (BAS) for real-world assurance.
* Continuous monitoring, retraining, and feedback loops ensure resilience against evolving threats.
