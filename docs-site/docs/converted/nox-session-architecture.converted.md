# üõ†Ô∏è Nox Session Architecture & CI/CD Integration

Automation Progress 100% Session Review Complete

## üîéOverview

ShieldCraft AI leverages a modular, parallel-safe Nox session architecture to automate all aspects of code quality, security, documentation, testing, and deployment. This ensures that every CI/CD run is reproducible, traceable, and production-grade.

## üìãSession Table & Responsibilities

| Session/Function | File | Purpose | Parallel-Safe | CI/CD | Notes |

| docker_build | docker.py | Builds all Docker images (main, api, ingestion) | Yes | Yes | Run after all quality gates |
| docker_scan | docker.py | Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities | Yes | Yes | Run after docker_build |
| docs | docs.py | Builds Docusaurus documentation | Yes | Yes | Parallel with other checks |
| docs_dev | docs.py | Runs Docusaurus dev server (local) | Yes | No | Local only |
| docs_lint | docs.py | Lints Markdown docs | Yes | Yes | Quality gate |
| lint | lint.py | Lint code with ruff and black | Yes | Yes | Quality gate |

| notebooks | notebook.py | Test Jupyter notebooks with nbval | Yes | Yes | Quality gate |
| notebook_lint | notebook.py | Lint/format notebooks | Yes | Yes | Parallel with other gates |
| bump_version | release.py | Bump project version and commit | Yes | No | Manual release only |
| release | release.py | Automate version bump, changelog, tag, push | Yes | No | Manual release only |
| checklist | release.py | Update checklist progress bar | Yes | No | Project management |
| security | security.py | Run safety and bandit security checks | Yes | Yes | Quality gate |
| safety | security.py | Run only safety vulnerability scan | Yes | Yes | Parallel with other gates |
| tests | test.py | Run all tests with pytest and coverage | Yes | Yes | Quality gate |
| test_fast | test.py | Run only fast/unit tests | Yes | Yes | Quick feedback |
| check | test.py | Meta-session: lint, typecheck, tests, safety, precommit | Yes | Yes | Meta-session |
| ci | test.py | Meta-session: all CI-required sessions | Yes | Yes | Meta-session |
| all | test.py | Meta-session: everything (local/dev) | Yes | No | Meta-session |
| file_hash | utils.py | Compute SHA256 hash of a file | Yes | Yes | Dependency change detection |
| nox_session_guard | utils.py | Decorator for robust error handling | Yes | Yes | All sessions |

## üîÑSession Sequencing & Best Practices

* Run all quality gates (lint, typecheck, docs_lint, security, notebooks, tests) in parallelfor fast feedback and fail-fast behavior.
* Only proceed to docker_build and docker_scan if all gates pass.
* Meta-sessions (check, ci, all) are for local/dev use and orchestration, not for CI/CD parallel jobs.
* Release and version bump sessions are manual and should be restricted to authorized users.
* Utility functions enforce reproducibility, fail-fast, and robust error handling across all sessions.

## üß†Architectural Insights

* All sessions are single-responsibility, parallel-safe, and reproducible, enabling scalable, production-grade automation.
* Hash-based dependency checks and marker files ensure environments are only rebuilt when necessary.
* Centralized error handling and logging make debugging in CI/CD straightforward.
* Meta-sessions provide local developer convenience without sacrificing CI/CD speed or reliability.
* Security gates are pragmatic, allowing deploys only when vulnerabilities are unfixable and documented (e.g., mlflow).

## üöÄNext Steps

* Upload test, lint, and security artifacts in CI for traceability and compliance.
* Further tune Poetry and Docker caching for even faster builds.
* Integrate CDK deploy/config sync into CI/CD for full infra automation.
* Expand onboarding docs for contributors, referencing this session architecture.
