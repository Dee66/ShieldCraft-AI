# üß™ Automated Attack Simulation & Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)

ShieldCraft AI continuously simulates real-world attack scenarios to validate controls, uncover gaps, and drive automated remediation ensuring proactive, enterprise-grade defense. BAS is a cornerstone of modern security, enabling continuous validation and resilience against evolving threats.

## Key Features

* Continuous Attack Simulation:Regularly launches simulated attacks (e.g., phishing, lateral movement, privilege escalation) to test detection and response capabilities.
* Breach & Attack Simulation (BAS):Validates security controls, policies, and incident response workflows against real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
* Automated Remediation:Integrates with ShieldCraft AI‚Äôs response engine to trigger automated containment, alerting, and recovery actions.
* Coverage & Reporting:Tracks coverage across MITRE ATT&CK, CIS, and custom threat scenarios, providing actionable reports for SOC and compliance teams.
* Safe for Production:All simulations are non-destructive, scoped, and auditable, ensuring no impact to business operations.
* Integration with Threat Detection:Simulated attacks validate and stress-test ML, GenAI, and UEBA pipelines for ongoing assurance.

## How It Works

* Simulations are scheduled or triggered on-demand, covering a range of attack vectors and TTPs.
* Detection pipelines (ML, GenAI, UEBA) are monitored for response accuracy, speed, and coverage.
* Automated remediation and alerting workflows are validated in real time.
* Results are reported to SOC dashboards and compliance logs for auditability.
* Feedback loops drive continuous improvement of detection and response logic.

## Architectural Insights

* BAS modules are modular, extensible, and cloud-native, leveraging AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and custom scripts for simulation orchestration.
* All simulations are parameterized for environment, scope, and impact, supporting safe production testing.
* Integration with threat detection ensures real-world validation and continuous assurance.
* Comprehensive reporting supports compliance, audit, and executive visibility.
