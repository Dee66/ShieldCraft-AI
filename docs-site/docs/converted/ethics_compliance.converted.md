# üõ°Ô∏è ShieldCraft AI: Ethics, Safety & Compliance

## üåç Overview
I am committed to building responsible, trustworthy AI systems. This document details the foundational steps taken to address ethics, safety, and compliance for the MVP phase, ensuring alignment with legal, regulatory, and societal expectations.

### 1. Initial Bias Audit

* Objective:Identify and mitigate potential sources of bias in data, models, and outputs.
* Actions:Review training and input data for representativeness and fairness.Analyze model outputs for disparate impact across user groups.Document findings and remediation steps.
* Status:Baseline audit completed for MVP data sources and model selection.

### 2. Hallucination Mitigation Strategy

* Objective:Reduce risk of LLM-generated misinformation or unsafe outputs.
* Actions:Implement output validation and fact-checking routines.Use prompt engineering to constrain model behavior.Log and review flagged outputs for continuous improvement.
* Status:Draft strategy in place; ongoing monitoring planned.

### 3. Legal Review for Data Privacy

* Objective:Ensure all data handling complies with POPIA, GDPR, and other relevant regulations.
* Actions:Data flow mapping and privacy impact assessment (PIA) conducted.Legal counsel reviewed data collection, storage, and processing plans.User consent and data subject rights processes documented.
* Status:Initial legal review complete; further review scheduled pre-launch.

### 4. Compliance Requirements

* Objective:Document and plan for all applicable compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, POPIA, etc.).
* Actions:Compliance matrix created, mapping requirements to controls.MVP controls implemented for data security, access, and auditability.Plan for certification and regular audits post-MVP.
* Status:Requirements documented; controls in place for MVP.

### 5. Compliance Review Schedule

* Objective:Ensure ongoing compliance and risk management.
* Actions:Quarterly compliance reviews scheduled.Assign compliance officer for ongoing oversight.
* Status:Review cadence established; first review post-MVP launch.

### 6. Security Architecture Review Board

* Objective:Formalize security and compliance governance.
* Actions:Board charter drafted; cross-functional team identified.Board to review architecture, incidents, and policy updates.
* Status:Board established; first meeting scheduled.

## üìã Next Steps

* Expand bias audit to cover new data sources as system scales.
* Refine hallucination mitigation with real-world feedback.
* Prepare for external compliance audits (SOC2, GDPR, POPIA).
