# ⚡ Automated Alert Triage, Investigation, and Remediation

GenAI-powered workflows in ShieldCraft AI accelerate incident response, reduce false positives, and minimize business disruption. This capability streamlines security operations, enabling SOC teams to focus on what matters most.

## Key Features

* Automated Triage:GenAI and ML models prioritize alerts based on risk, context, and historical patterns, reducing analyst workload.
* Investigation Workflows:Orchestrates evidence gathering, context enrichment, and root cause analysis using AI-driven playbooks.
* Remediation Automation:Integrates with AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and custom scripts to trigger containment, recovery, and notification actions.
* False Positive Reduction:Behavioral analytics and GenAI filter out noise, surfacing only actionable incidents.
* Human-in-the-Loop:Analysts can review, approve, or override automated actions, ensuring control and accountability.
* Continuous Learning:Feedback loops improve triage accuracy and response speed over time.

## How It Works

* Alerts are ingested from diverse sources (logs, endpoints, cloud, network) and processed in real time.
* GenAI and ML models analyze alert data, enrich context, and prioritize based on risk and impact.
* Automated playbooks guide investigation, evidence collection, and decision-making.
* Remediation actions are triggered automatically or with analyst approval.
* All actions are logged for auditability and compliance.
* Feedback from analysts is used to retrain models and improve future triage.

## Architectural Insights

* Alert triage pipelines are modular, scalable, and cloud-native, leveraging AWS services for orchestration and automation.
* GenAI components (Bedrock, LangChain) drive context enrichment, summarization, and decision support.
* Integration with threat detection and BAS ensures triage logic is validated against real-world scenarios.
* Human-in-the-loop controls support compliance, audit, and operational flexibility.
