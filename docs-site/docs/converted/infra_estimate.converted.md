# üõ°Ô∏è ShieldCraft AI: Baseline Infrastructure & Cloud Usage Estimate

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Baseline Infrastructure

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (primary), with multi-cloud/pluggable support in roadmap
- **Core Services:**
  - Amazon ECS/EKS (container orchestration)
  - S3 (object storage)
  - RDS/Postgres (relational DB, vector DB via pgvector)
  - Lambda (serverless tasks)
  - CloudWatch (logging/monitoring)
  - VPC, Security Groups, IAM (networking/security)
  - Bedrock (GenAI/LLM)
  - SQS/SNS (eventing/notifications)
  - Secrets Manager (secrets management)
- **DevOps:**

## üí∏ Cloud Usage Estimate (MVP Phase)

All pricing is estimated in South African Rand (ZAR/R), based on AWS public pricing as of July 2025. Actual costs may vary by region, usage, and discounts. Exchange rate used: 1 USD ‚âà R18.50.
