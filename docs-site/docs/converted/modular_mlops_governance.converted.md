# üß© Modular System Layers, MLOps Flow & Security/Data Governance

This document details the modular architecture, MLOps lifecycle, and security/data governance design for ShieldCraft AI.

## 1. Modular System Architecture & MLOps Diagram

![ShieldCraft AI Modular MLOps Flow Diagram](./assets/mlops_flow.svg) Figure: Modular MLOps flow showing data, model, and governance layers

* Ingestion Layer:Handles data collection from logs, threat feeds, APIs, and user input. Supports batch and streaming.
* Processing Layer:Cleans, normalizes, and enriches data. Includes privacy controls and versioning.
* AI/Analytics Layer:Hosts GenAI models, RAG, and analytics. Modular for easy model swaps and upgrades.
* Application Layer:API endpoints, UI, and integrations. Stateless, scalable, and secure.
* Storage Layer:Data lake, vector DB, and metadata stores. Encryption and access controls enforced. Benefits: * Separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability
* Each layer can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
* Security boundaries between layers

## 2. MLOps Flow

- **Automated Pipelines:**
  - Data ingestion, validation, and versioning
  - Model training, evaluation, and registry (SageMaker/MLflow)
  - Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for models and code
  - Canary and shadow deployments for safe model updates

- **Experiment Tracking:**
  - All experiments logged with parameters, metrics, and artifacts
  - Rollback and audit trails for all model changes

- **Monitoring & Feedback:**
  - Automated monitoring for drift, performance, and cost
  - Human-in-the-loop feedback for prompt/model improvement

## 3. Security & Data Governance

- **Data Privacy:**
  - Masking, anonymization, and minimization at ingestion and processing
  - Data retention and deletion policies
  - Regular privacy impact assessments ([see doc](./privacy_impact_assessment.md))

- **Access Control:**
  - IAM roles and least-privilege access
  - Centralized secrets management ([see doc](security/aws-secrets-management.converted.md))
  - Audit logging for all access and changes

- **Compliance:**
  - Automated checks for GDPR, SOC2, POPIA, etc.
  - Documentation and evidence collection for audits
  - Regular reviews and updates ([see doc](./ethics_compliance.md))

- **Security Posture:**
  - Threat modeling and adversarial testing ([see doc](./threat_modeling.md))
  - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
  - Incident response plan and runbooks
