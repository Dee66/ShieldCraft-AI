# üìä Real-Time, Actionable Dashboards for SOC Teams

ShieldCraft AI provides security teams with deep visibility, context-aware intelligence, and rapid decision support through real-time, actionable dashboards. These dashboards are designed for SOC analysts, incident responders, and executive stakeholders to monitor, investigate, and respond to threats efficiently.

## Key Features

* Real-Time Data Visualization:Live threat feeds, alerts, and telemetry visualized for instant situational awareness.
* Context-Aware Intelligence:Dashboards correlate threat data, behavioral analytics, and GenAI insights for deeper context.
* Rapid Decision Support:Automated recommendations, risk scoring, and incident prioritization accelerate analyst workflows.
* Customizable Views:Role-based dashboards for SOC analysts, incident responders, and executives.
* Integrated Response Actions:One-click containment, investigation, and remediation directly from the dashboard.
* Compliance & Audit Reporting:Built-in reporting for regulatory, audit, and executive needs.
* Integration with Threat Detection & BAS:Dashboards surface results from ML, GenAI, UEBA, and attack simulation modules for unified visibility.

## How It Works

* Data from threat detection, attack simulation, and telemetry pipelines is aggregated and visualized in real time.
* Dashboards provide drill-downs, timelines, and context for each alert and incident.
* Analysts can take response actions, assign incidents, and track remediation progress directly from the interface.
* Executive and compliance views provide high-level summaries and audit trails.
* Continuous feedback loops improve dashboard relevance and usability.

## Architectural Insights

* Dashboards are built using cloud-native, scalable visualization frameworks (e.g., Grafana, OpenSearch Dashboards, custom React/TypeScript).
* Role-based access controls ensure secure, tailored views for different user groups.
* Integration with AWS services (CloudWatch, OpenSearch, Lambda) enables real-time data flow and automation.
* All dashboard actions are logged for compliance and auditability.
* Continuous improvement driven by analyst feedback and evolving threat landscape.
