- **Generative AI Insights:**  
  Integrates with Amazon Bedrock for contextual recommendations and automated incident summaries.

- **Cloud-Native Architecture:**  
  Built on AWS services including SageMaker, ECS/EKS, Lambda, Glue, S3, and CDK for scalable, secure deployments.

- **End-to-End MLOps:**  
  Automated pipelines for model training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.

- **Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance:**  
  Fine-grained IAM, Secrets Manager, private networking, and continuous compliance checks.

- **Operational Dashboards:**  
  Real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident management for SOC teams.
